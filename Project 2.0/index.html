                Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design
                philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language
                constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                large-scale projects.
                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often
                described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C
                programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern
                C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level
                memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide
                C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is
                available on many platforms.C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded,
                resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as
                its design highlights.

                C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign) is a
                general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing,
                lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and
                component-oriented programming disciplines.

                C# was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an
                international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. It was designed by
                Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen, being one of the
                programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).
